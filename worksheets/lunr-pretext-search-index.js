This activity is intended to help you review some of the algebraic functions you saw in previous math courses. Please feel free to work together. If you get stuck, just ask and we'll get unstuck.  Please note, some of these questions have answers that will require you to write complete sentences in order to help you make better sense of the math you're learning. This may seem difficult at first.      Consider the problem: find a linear function with slope whose -intercept is at .     Find a formula for and sketch its graph.      What transformations were applied to the function to obtain ?      Now suppose that instead of having a -intercept at , we want a function whose graph passes through the point . What additional transformation needs to be applied to your basic function to get this new function? Find the formula for this transformation and graph it. How else have we described this formula for a linear function?         In this exercise, we will describe the vertex form as a sequence of transformations applied to .     Find the formula for a quadratic function whose vertex is at and whose graph passes through the point .      What transformations are applied (give them in the correct order too) to to obtain the function you found in part (a)?      Consider the general quadratic function in vertex form Describe the sequence of transformations, in the correct order, that you use to create from the parent function .         Here's another way to find the vertex of a quadratic using simpler functions and shifts. Consider the function We can write this as a vertical shift of the function upward by units. Notice that This means (from which came) has easily identified zeros at and . Its vertex lies halfway between them at . Then we can compute the -value of the vertex of to be Thus, the vertex of is units higher at .
