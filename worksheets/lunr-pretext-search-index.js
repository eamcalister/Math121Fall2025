  "body": " Math 121 Week 9 Activity   In this activity we will do the following:    Use new identities to find exact expressions for sines and cosines of more angles than the \"special\" angles.    Justify one identity using geometry, then deduce further identities using the one we justified.      Please note, some of these questions have answers that will require you to write complete sentences in order to help you make better sense of the math you're learning. This may seem difficult at first.     The Angle Sum Identities  If and are angles, then we have      Let's warm up by using these identities. Use identities and the exact values of and for , , and to find the following:      ( Hint: Convert the first quadrant special angles to all have as the denominator to see how is a sum of two of them.)                       Now we will justify the identity using geometry.      In the diagram to the right, use right triangle trigonometry to find in terms of and . Then use your expression to find the area of in terms of , , , and .

Finally, notice that the whole big triangle has an area equal to the sum of the two smaller triangles. Write that as an equation using parts (a)-(c) to deduce our identity.
