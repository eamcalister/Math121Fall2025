# PreTeXt Codespace

Use this template repository to quickly start a new [PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org) project entirely in the cloud, using GitHub Codespaces.  

## Instructions

Look for the green button at the very top right of this page.  The button should say `Use this template` (if not make sure you are logged in to GitHub). 
  
Click on the button and select "Create a new repository".  On the next page, give your project a name, select public or private (this can be changed later), and click the "Create repository from template" button.

You now have a GitHub repository saved in your account.  You can come back to that page any time you want to work on your project (note the URL or else find it in the list of your repositories when you log in to GitHub).

To start work on your project, go to the green button at the top of *your* repository's page, which will say `<> Code`.  

1. Click on this button.
2. Click on the tab that says "Codespaces."
3. Click "Create codespace on main."

From here, you will want to follow instructions contained in the template/FLC Pretext Canvas page.
