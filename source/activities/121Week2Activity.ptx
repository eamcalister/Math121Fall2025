            <introduction>
                <p>
                    This activity is intended to help you review some of the algebraic functions you saw in previous math courses. Please feel free to work together. If you get stuck, just ask and we'll get unstuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note, some of these questions have answers that will require you to write complete sentences in order to help you make better sense of the math you're learning. This may seem difficult at first.

                         Consider the problem: find a linear function <m>y = p(x)</m> with slope <m>2</m> whose <m>y</m>-intercept is at <m>y=7</m>.

                            Find a formula for <m>p(x)</m> and sketch its graph.

                            What transformations were applied to the function <m>f(x) = x</m> to obtain <m>p(x)</m>?

What additional transformation needs to be applied to your basic function <m>f(x)=x</m> to get this new function? Find the formula for this transformation and graph it. How else have we described this formula for a linear function?

            <p>
                In this exercise, we will think about the vertex form as a sequence of transformations applied to <m>g(x) = x^2</m>. Then we will explore what you're really doing when you "solve for <m>a</m>" in finding the formula for a quadratic with a given vertex through a prescribed point.

<task workspace="1.5in">
    <statement>
        <p>
            Consider the general quadratic function in vertex form
            <me>
                q(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k.
            </me>
            Describe the sequence of transformations, in the correct order, that you use to create <m>q(x)</m> from the parent function <m>g(x) = x^2</m>.
        </p>

<task workspace="1.5in">
    <statement>
        <p>
            Find the formula for a quadratic function <m>Q(x)</m> whose vertex is at <m>(3,2)</m> and whose graph passes through the point <m>(5,4)</m>.

            Now undo the transformations described in part (a) to find the point on the graph of <m>g(x)=x^2</m> that was transformed to the point <m>(5,4)</m> on the graph of your function in part (b) (you could call this the "parent point" of <m>(5,4)</m>). When you have that, write a sentence or two (in your own words, to the best of your abilities) about why the value of <m>a</m> makes sense.

<example>
    <p>
        Here's another way to find the vertex of a quadratic using simpler functions and shifts. Consider the function
<me>
h(x) = 2x^2-6x+20. 
</me>
We can write this as a vertical shift of the function <me>f(x) = 2x^2-6x</me> upward by <m>20</m> units. Notice that
<md>
    <mrow> f(x) \amp = 2x^2 - 6x</mrow>
    <mrow> \amp = 2x(x-3)</mrow>
</md>

This means <m>f(x)</m> (from which <m>h(x)</m> came) has easily identified zeros at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=3</m>. It's vertex lies halfway between them at <m>x=1.5</m>. Then we can compute the <m>y</m>-value of this vertex to be 
<me>
f(1.5) = 2\cdot 1.5 \cdot (-1.5) = -4.5.
</me>
Thus, the vertex of <m>h(x)</m> is <m>20</m> units higher at <m>y = 15.5</m>. So the vertex form of <m>g(x)</m> is
<me>
g(x) = 2x^2-6x+20 = 2(x-1.5)^2 + 15.5
</me>
    </p>
</example>

<exercise workspace="3in">
    <statement>
        <p>
            Use the idea from the example to put the function
<me>
h(x) = -3x^2+5x - 7 = -3x\left(x-\frac{5}{3}\right) -7
</me>
into vertex form.
        </p>
    </statement>
