            <introduction>
                <p>
                    This activity is intended to help you review some of the algebraic functions you saw in previous math courses. Please feel free to work together. If you get stuck, just ask and we'll get unstuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note, some of these questions have answers that will require you to write complete sentences in order to help you make better sense of the math you're learning. This may seem difficult at first.

What additional transformation needs to be applied to your basic function <m>f(x)=x</m> to get this new function? Find the formula for this transformation and graph it. How else have we described this formula for a linear function?

<example>
    <p>
        Here's another way to find the vertex of a quadratic using simpler functions and shifts. Consider the function
<me>
h(x) = 2x^2-6x+20. 
</me>
We can write this as a vertical shift of the function <me>f(x) = 2x^2-6x</me> upward by <m>20</m> units. Notice that
<md>
    <mrow> f(x) \amp = 2x^2 - 6x</mrow>
    <mrow> \amp = 2x(x-3)</mrow>
</md>

This means <m>f(x)</m> (from which <m>h(x)</m> came) has easily identified zeros at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=3</m>. Its vertex lies halfway between them at <m>x=1.5</m>. Then we can compute the <m>y</m>-value of the vertex of <m>f(x)</m> to be 
<me>
f(1.5) = 2\cdot 1.5 \cdot (-1.5) = -4.5.
</me>
Thus, the vertex of <m>h(x)</m> is <m>20</m> units higher at <m>y = 15.5</m>. So the vertex form of <m>h(x)</m> is
<me>
h(x) = 2x^2-6x+20 = 2(x-1.5)^2 + 15.5
</me>
    </p>
</example>

<exercise workspace="3in">
    <statement>
        <p>
            Use the idea from the example given above to put the function
<me>
h(x) = -3x^2+5x - 7 = -3x\left(x-\frac{5}{3}\right) -7
</me>
into vertex form.
