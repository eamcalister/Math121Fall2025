    <title>Math 121 Week 7 Activity</title>

        <objectives>
		<p>
            In this activity we will do the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
	  		<li>
	  			<p>
					Use trig and inverse trig functions to find sides and angles on right triangles
	  			</p>
	  		</li>
            <li>
                <p>
                  Apply right triangle trigonometry to practical applications
                </p>
            </li>

	  	</ul>
    </objectives>
            <introduction>
                <p>
                  Please feel free to work together. If you get stuck, just ask and we'll get unstuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note, some of these questions have answers that will require you to write complete sentences in order to help you make better sense of the math you're learning. This may seem difficult at first.
                </p>

   <introduction>
    <p>
       Suppose car A is 30 miles due North of an intersection traveling towards it and car B is 50 miles due East of the intersection traveling towards it.
    </p>
   </introduction> 
   <task workspace = "3in">
    <p>
    What angle would car A have to turn (in degrees) so that it is pointed directly at car B?
    </p>
</task>
<task workspace = "2in">
<p>
    If car A stays put, how far would car B have to travel for this angle to become 20 degrees?
</p>
</task>
<task workspace = "2in">
<p>
    If car B stays put, how far would car A have to travel for this angle to become 70 degrees?

   <introduction>
    <p>
        Suppose you ride an escalator that is moving at 5 feet per second. The escalator is 50 feet tall and takes 20 seconds to ride from bottom to top.
    </p>
   </introduction> 
   <task workspace = "2in">
    <p>
    How long is the escalator? (this should be the hypotenuse of a triangle)
    </p>
</task>
<task workspace = "2in">
<p>
     What is the angle of ascent of the escalator?
</p>
</task>
<task workspace = "3in">
<p> 
How many vertical feet does the escalator gain per second? 
</p>  
</task>
<task workspace = "3in">
<p> 
How many horizontal feet does the escalator traverse per second? 
</p>  
</task>

    <p>
        Suppose you ski down a slope at a fixed angle that drops 1000 feet over a horizontal displacement of 3500 feet.
    </p>
   </introduction> 
<task workspace = "2in">
<p>
    What is the angle of the slope from horizontal?
</p>
</task>
<task workspace = "4in">
<p>
If satellite data measures your horizontal speed to be <m>25 </m> feet per second, how quickly are you moving across the snow? 
</p>   
</task>
<task workspace = "3in">
    <p>
   At the speed from part b, how quickly are you losing elevation?
