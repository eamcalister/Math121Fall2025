        <objectives>
		<p>
            In this activity we will do the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
	  		<li>
	  			<p>
					Review the basic forms of linear, quadratic, and exponential functions.
	  			</p>
	  		</li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Identify functions of each of the above types from their graphs.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Find formulas for functions in the families given above from points on their graphs.
                </p>
            </li>

            <introduction>
                <p>
                    This activity asks students to describe the effect of different affine transformation of functions after experimenting with Desmos. The pre-built Desmos graph appears in the html version while a QR code is created in the print version.
