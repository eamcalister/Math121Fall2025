            <introduction>
                <p>
                  Please feel free to work together. If you get stuck, just ask and we'll get unstuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note, some of these questions have answers that will require you to write complete sentences in order to help you make better sense of the math you're learning. This may seem difficult at first.
                </p>
                  <p>
                Recall the notion of an <term> inverse function </term> , <m>f^{-1}, </m> to a function <m> f </m>:    
            </p>
            <p>
                The function <m>f^{-1} </m> is defined, for <m> y </m> in the range of <m> f,</m> by <m> f^{-1}(y) = x </m> if <m>f(x) =y .</m> 
            </p>
            <p> 
                We can find a formula for <m> f^{-1} </m> from a formula for <m> f </m> by solving for <m> x </m> in terms of <m> y.</m>
        </p>
        <p> <em> Note: </em> However, this only works for those <m> y</m> for which there is exactly one value of <m> x </m> in the domain of <m> f</m> such that <m> f(x) = y. </m> 
        </p>
        <p>
            If <m> f </m> attains certain <m> y </m> values for more than one <m> x, </m> we can <em> restrict the domain</em> of <m> f </m> so that <m> f </m> attains each value in its range exactly once on this new domain and define <m> f^{-1} </m> to be the inverse of <m> f </m> on this new domain, i.e. for <m> x </m> in the new domain, <m> f^{-1}(y) = x </m> if and only if <m> f(x) = y. </m>
    </p>

            First, let's practice this with 
        <m> f(x) =x^2 .</m> 
        </p>
    </introduction>
<task workspace = "3in">
    <p>
What is the range of <m> f </m>? For each <m> y </m> in the range of <m> f ,</m> how many <m> x </m> values satisfy <m> y = f(x) = x^2 </m>?
    </p>
</task>

<task workspace = "3in">
    <p>
Thus, <m> f(x) = x^2 </m> does not have an inverse on the entirety of its domain. Instead we need to restrict its domain to define the inverse. What do we need to restrict the domain of <m>f </m> to for <m> x = \sqrt{y} </m> to be the inverse of <m> f(x) = x^2 </m> on this domain?

         Now, suppose a carousel has two rings of horses. The inner ring is <m> 2 </m> meters from the center and the outer ring is <m> 4 </m> meters from the center and each ring of horses moves up and down synchronously.

                What angle (in radians) must an inner ring horse traverse to travel <m> 8</m> meters (in the horizontal plane)? How far does an outer ring horse travel across this same angle?

            <p>
                 Suppose the height (in meters) of an outer ring horse (as it bobs up and down) is given by <m>O(\theta) = 1-\cos(\theta)</m> where <m>\theta</m> is the angle the carousel has rotated from the starting position. Sketch a graph of <m> O(\theta).</m>

            <p> Now, if the height function for an inner ring horse has the same amplitude, midline, and period as the height function for the outer ring horse, but an inner ring horse is at the bottom when an outer ring horse is at the top (and vice versa), write an equation <m>I(\theta),</m> for a graph of the height of an inner ring horse and sketch a graph of <m>I(\theta).</m> </p>
