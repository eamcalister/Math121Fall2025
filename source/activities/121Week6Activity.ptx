            <introduction>
                <p>
                  Please feel free to work together. If you get stuck, just ask and we'll get unstuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please note, some of these questions have answers that will require you to write complete sentences in order to help you make better sense of the math you're learning. This may seem difficult at first.

        <p>
         Now, suppose a carousel has two rings of horses. The inner ring is <m> 2 </m> meters from the center and the outer ring is <m> 4 </m> meters from the center and each ring of horses moves up and down synchronously.   
        </p>

        <statement>
            <p>
                What angle (in radians) must an inner ring horse traverse to travel <m> 8</m> meters (in the horizontal plane)? How far does an outer ring horse travel across this same angle?
            </p>
            <p>
                 Suppose the height (in meters) of an outer ring horse (as it bobs up and down) is given by <m>O(\theta) = 1-\cos(\theta)</m> where <m>\theta</m> is the angle the carousel has rotated from the starting position. Sketch a graph of <m> O(\theta).</m>
            </p>
            <p> Now, if the height function for an inner ring horse has the same amplitude, midline, and period as the height function for the outer ring horse, but an inner ring horse is at the bottom when an outer ring horse is at the top (and vice versa), write an equation <m>I(\theta),</m> for a graph of the height of an inner ring horse and sketch a graph of <m>I(\theta).</m> </p>
        <p>
             If the carousel stops halfway around its rotation, what height are the inner ring horses at and what height are the outer ones at? What if the carousel stops <m> 3/8 </m> of the way around? <m> 2/3 </m> of the way around?
